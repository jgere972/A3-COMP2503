 * COMP 2503 Fall 2023 Assignment 3 Avenger Statistics

 * This program reads a input stream and keeps track of the statistics for avengers
 * mentioned by name, alias, or performer's last name.
 * The program uses a BST
 * for storing the data. Multiple BSTs with alternative orderings are
 * constructed to show the required output.
